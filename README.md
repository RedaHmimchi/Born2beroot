Born2beroot is a project in which you will create a secure virtual machine with:
  - Strong Password policy
  - Sudo rules
  - Firewall setup
  - Crypted disk partition
  - Host a web server with WordPress, MariaDB, and Lighttpd in the bonus part.

In this project, I learned a lot about virtualization, system administration, SSH, Firewalls, setup of a web server, LVM, Linux commands, and Bash scripting.
